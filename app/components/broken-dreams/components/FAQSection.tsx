      question: 'Do I need to create a Nut.new account before submitting my app?',
      answer:
        'Yes, it would make things easier if you create an account before filling out the submission form, and be sure to use the same email that is connected to your Nut.new account, so we can find it, and stuff it with free credits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes Nut.new different than other vibecoding tools out there?',
      answer:
        "This is our favorite question to answer. Other vibecoding tools are simply wrappers on an LLM. This is why it's so common that people get into debugging death spirals. The LLMs are just not great at iterating and evolving code. They hallucinate, they lose context, and one small change can lead you down a path of frustration.\n\nNut was built from the ground up with a different philosophy that, hey, AI (LLMs) writes buggy code. Accepting that fact, we built Nut.new around our already existing code debugging tools. Nut.new thoroughly tests your app from top to bottom, front-end to back-end, and instructs the LLM what went wrong and how to fix it.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Am I required to become a paying customer?',
      answer:
        "Nope. After you use your free $50 in credits (we call them Peanuts, btw), you can continue using Nut on our free plan. Of course, we'd love to have you as a paying customer, but not a requirement for this.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How many credits do I get for $50?',
      answer:
        "$50 is 5,000 peanuts (that's our cute name for our credits). That's a significant amount of peanuts to build real stuff with Nut. In addition to the 5k peanuts, all new customers are giving 1,000 peanuts to start with. So you'll have 6,000 peanuts to work with. Pretty sweet, eh?",
    },
    {
      question: "What if you can't help me get my app working?",
      answer:
        "Well, we hope that won't be the case, but there are one or two realists on the team that admit that this could be a possibility. The good news is that you wouldn't have wasted money (but I suppose we would have. hmmm).\n\nWe'll be honest though, Nut can't build everything under the sun. Right now, it's really quite good at building full-stack web apps (CRUD apps as they're called, for Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n\nSo if you want to build a slick iOS app, well, we're not there yet. Also, if you're trying to beat Zuck by building the next version of Facebook to support over a billion daily active users, then we can't help you with that either—yet!",
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes the team confident they can rebuild my broken app, anyway?',
      answer:
        "So glad you asked! Our team has been spending their careers creating code debugging software, and it turns out that vibecoding with AI writes a lot of buggy code (go figure!). We built Nut.new around our core deterministic debugging tools, which makes us very very different from all of the other vibecoder tools out there.\n\nWe are NOT just a wrapper on an LLM. Nut writes code, but it also writes automated tests to verify that the code it wrote actually works. When it doesn't work, we use our baked-in debugging software (Replay) to analyze what happened in your entire code base, and helps the AI fix it.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How will I claim my free credits?',
      answer: "After you submit your app via the form, we'll reach out with instructions.",
